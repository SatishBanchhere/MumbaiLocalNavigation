# MumbaiLocalNavigation

## Overview
MumbaiLocalNavigation is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project designed to help users find the shortest train route between two stations in Mumbai's local train network. It provides detailed instructions on when and where to change lines to ensure the shortest and most efficient journey.

## Features
- **Shortest Route Calculation:** Calculates the shortest train route between two stations.
- **Line Change Information:** Informs users when and where to change lines during their journey.
- **File Handling:** Uses file handling to get station names in the graph.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for inputting start and destination stations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Data Structures:** Adjacency Lists for representing the train network
- **File Handling:** Reads station names from a file to build the graph

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MumbaiLocalNavigation.git
   cd MumbaiLocalNavigation
2. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   g++ -o MumbaiLocalNavigation main.cpp
3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./MumbaiLocalNavigation
## Usage

1. **Start the program:**
   ```bash
   ./MumbaiLocalNavigation
2. **Enter the start station:**
   - Type the name of the starting station and press Enter.

3. **Enter the destination station:**
   - Type the name of the destination station and press Enter.

4. **View the route:**
   - The program will display the shortest route, including any necessary line changes.
